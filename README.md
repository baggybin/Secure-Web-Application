# Secure-Web-Application
Engineered a secure online shop application utilising Enterprise Java Beans, Servlets, JSP and HTML. Customers could browse through our book selections, add and remove them to a shopping cart and check our cancel the order. Customers were allowed to post and view comments on any book. Books were searchable.

The application was secure coded to protect against the OWASP top 10 securing threats, this included but was not limited to Injection, Cross Site Scripting, and broken authentication and session management. The application was tested via a application penetration test utilising Kali Linux.

Admin could search and edit any book entry or order via ID. Add and remove items, and increase and decrease the amount available. The application used limited access through an authentication scheme and access rights were role based. The application utilised a logging facility, and had protections against quantities going below zero.
